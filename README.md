# pokewin
SDL and SFML implementations of PRET PokeEmerald Assets

Building WINmap requires SFML

Building PokeWIN requires CSFML (SFML for C)

Documentation can be found in the files themselves, /docs/, or the wiki if I set it up

Altough its called "PokeWIN" it should try to be maintained that it compiles on linux

Notes:

The Structure of this program might change

The Structure and Functions should be similar enough to PRETs and GFs PokeEmeralds that a programmer in that should be able to jump into it.
